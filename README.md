## Overview

This project aims to optimize Starbucks app offers by targeting them more effectively to reduce revenue loss from unnecessary offers.

## Key Questions

- How much revenue is lost due to unnecessary offers?
- Which customer types frequently complete offers without viewing them?
- How does income differ across customer types and offer completion behavior?

## Data

- Customer demographics
- Offer interactions
- Transaction data

## Analysis

- Focuses on unnecessary offers (completed without viewing)
- Uses Jupyter Notebook for analysis (Data_Scientist_Capstone_Project.ipynb)
- Detailed results presented in Medium article (link: [INSERT ARTICLE LINK])

## Key Findings

- Unnecessary offers contribute to potential annual revenue loss of $588,384.
- Females spend more per transaction ($16.3) than males ($10.4) and are more likely to complete offers without viewing.
- Customers completing offers without viewing have higher average incomes, particularly for discount offers.

## Recommendations

- Target offers strategically:
    - Reassess BOGO offer distribution.
    - Reduce offers sent to females, especially discount offers.
    - Increase minimum purchase requirements for offers tailored to females.
- Personalize offer difficulty based on individual customer income levels.

## Further Research

- Explore additional customer characteristics influencing offer completion behavior.
- Develop predictive models for offer targeting optimization.
- Evaluate offer impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty.
